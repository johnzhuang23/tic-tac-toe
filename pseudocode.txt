create a 3x3 grid as the board

click the first cell, turn the cell to shape "x"
click the second cell, then the cell becomes shape "o"
if the cell has been clicked, it cannot be clicked again
    using classlist.add() to put the clicked cell into different classes;
    using once: true in addEventListener to make sure each cell can only be clicked once;
    using click %2 =0 to decide the cell will become x or o;

the condition of winning the game: the same shape is connected in a line, vertically, or horizontally, or diagonallyï¼š
    each cell, from left to right, up to down, is given a number :
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9 
    so the winning situation is the following combinations where each cell has the same new class name (x or o):
    123
    456
    789
    147
    258
    369
    159
    357
    
    use a loop to make a judegement, and because the quickest way to win a game needs at least 5 steps, so the judegement can start from the fifth click.

a windows pop up to tell which shape is the winner

if all the cells are clicked, but no winning condition is reached, pop up a windows say draw

a reset button to restart the game
